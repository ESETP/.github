# Hyasynth
This project was created as a 4th year Electronics and Software Engineering team project for the Univeristy of Glasgow. It is designed to be reprogrammable.

## Reprogram My Hyasynth
Check out [this guide](https://github.com/ESETP/LaserBee/blob/main/Flashing.md) to learn how to reprogram and flash your Hyasynth.

## Repository Breakdown
### [hyasynth-pcb](https://github.com/ESETP/hyasynth-pcb)
Kicad project for the PCB used. Contains assembly instructions.

### [LaserBee](https://github.com/ESETP/LaserBee)
Source code for the "laserbee" microcontroller (EFM8LB1). If you want to modify the program you should start here, you can also find a guide for programming the PCB at home.

### ESETP.github.io
Website landing page, not currently used

### AudioPWMDriver
Proof of concept PWM based sine wave synthesis, not currently used.

### Piccollo
Kicad project for our prototype PCB for testing the manufacturing capabilities of the univeristy. Uses an RP2040 microcontroller instead of the Laserbee.

### SynthBadge
A place we used to collect issues. Can now be found at Projects > Badge Project (currently private)
